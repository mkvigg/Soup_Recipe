<body>
This is my favorite Lentil soup. It's very simple, and I've cobbled it together by trying some <a href="http://allrecipes.com/search/default.aspx?qt=k&wt=lentil%20soup&rt=r&origin=Home%20Page">other recipes</a>, and then well, leaving stuff out. It is <strong>very, very simple</strong>, but it is also one of my favorite foods ever.<div id="Lentil Soup"><img src="images/FinishedSoup.jpg"</div> <alt="soup"/> <p>Here are the ingredients:</p>
<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
<ul>
<li>
1 Carrot, chopped
</li>
<li>
1 Onion, chopped
</li>
<li>
1 Stalk celery, chopped
</li>
<li>
1/2 pound of green lentils
</li>
<li>
1 28 oz can of whole tomatoes
</li>
<li>
28 oz cold water
</li>
<li>
2 bay leaves
</li>
<li>
tiny pinch of cumin (maybe 1/8 of a tsp)
</li>
<li>
tiny pinch of ground thyme (again, like, 1/8 of a tsp)
</li>
<li>
1 tbsp of vinegar
</li>

<h2>Instructions:</h2>
<p>
Simple to do. Sweat the veggies over low heat with a little kosher salt. When the onion is translucent, add lentils and stir. Cook them with the veggies for a couple minutes. Add tomatoes, water, cumin, and bay leaves. Bring to a boil. Simmer covered for 1 hour to 1 1/2 hour. Add the vinegar and thyme, cook for another minute or two. Add salt to taste.

I like my lentil soup this way, without too many herbs or any chicken broth. Recipes that call for those things are nice enough, but I like the brightness and mild acidity the soup has this way. I think it complements the earthy flavor of the lentils and the mirepoix.

<h4><span class="sarcasm">Important reminders and tips:</span></h4>
<ul>
<li>
 Wash your lentils. And I did find a stone once, so keep an eye out.
</li>

 I like to use red wine vinegar in this, but I have used apple cider vinegar in a pinch, and I'm sure other vinegars could be fun. I mean, not white distilled of course. That stuff is for cleaning the coffee pot and disinfecting the cutting board, IMHO.

 Salt is key. I just made a batch of this and had to adjust the salt a couple times. The flavor is subtle so you need to use enough to bring it out, but if you use to much you'll overpower it. When I eat alone, I add salt in the bowl until it tastes about right. I think Kosher salt may do a noticeably better job here. Thanks to Carlo who got me paying more attention to my salt after a conversation we had awhile ago.
